# IPN Generator
The IPN Generator is a Python program that generates unique internal reference numbers (IPN) for different categories based on a set of rules. It takes a JSON input file containing data for different items and generates new IPNs for items that don't have one or have a duplicate IPN.

## Installation
To use the IPN Generator, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need to have the following packages installed: json. You can install these packages by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the IPN Generator, you need to create a JSON input file that contains the data for the items you want to generate IPNs for. The input file should have the following format:
```shell

[
    {    "Item Code": 3137,
        "Item Name": "10 Volumes The Great Discoveries of Archaeology",
        "Item Description": "Book",
        "IPN - Internal reference number": "00000100179",
        "Category ID": 9,
        "Category Name": "000001 - BOOKS",
        "Default Location ID": 2,
        "Active": "1",
        "In Stock": "1.00000",
        "Creation Date": "2023-03-05",
        "Creation User": 1,
        "Responsible": ""}
]

```
You can run the program by navigating to the directory where the program is stored and running the following command:
```shell
python3 ipn-generator.py
```
The program will loop through each item in the input file and generate a new IPN for items that don't have one or have a duplicate IPN. The new IPNs will be printed to the console.

Please note that the program generates new IPNs based on a set of rules and does not guarantee uniqueness. Please review the generated IPNs before using them and modify the program if necessary to ensure unique IPNs.
## Note
The example "input.json" file used in this script is generated by Inventree, an open-source inventory management system. You can learn more about Inventree on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/inventree).
